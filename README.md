# Rubellite

Rubellite is another name for red tourmaline, a cheaper alternative to a ruby. This gem is a mish-mash of custom methods expanding Ruby 2.6.2 built-in classes. Just for fun. Probably breaks a lot of stuff.

## Install

In Terminal:

1. `git clone git@gitlab.verisys.com:wcross/rubellite.git`
2. `cd rubellite`
3. `gem build rubellite.gemspec`
4. `gem install rubellite`

Now you can `require 'rubellite'`

Voila! You now have access to all my funky-junky custom methods!


## Uninstall

Delete the rubellite folder.
Delete the `.gem` file.
In Terminal: `gem uninstall rubellite`
